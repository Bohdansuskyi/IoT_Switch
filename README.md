# IoT Project: NodeMCU v3 with Relay (LED) Control via Django REST API

This project demonstrates how to control relays, LEDs, or other devices that require binary (True/False) state switching using the HTTP protocol. The project integrates a NodeMCU v3 with a Django REST Framework API, allowing state changes to be transmitted and controlled remotely. The Django application can be hosted on services like PythonAnywhere.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to learn how to control IoT devices (like relays and LEDs) using an HTTP-based API. By leveraging the Django REST Framework, we can easily handle API requests and toggle device states through the internet. The NodeMCU communicates with the Django backend, sending or receiving data to control device states.

## Features

1. Control relays or LEDs via HTTP GET requests.
2. Integration with Django REST API.
3. Easy deployment using PythonAnywhere.
4. Understanding the concept of IoT device control.

## Requirements

- **Django**: 5.0.7
- **Django REST Framework**: 3.15.2
- **django-filter**: 24.2
- **Markdown**: 3.6
- **Python**: 3.12.3 (You may use another version, but it is recommended to use Python 3.9 or newer.)
